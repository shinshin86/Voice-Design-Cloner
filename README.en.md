# VoiceDesignCloner

**A training data creation tool for building complete TTS models from original AI voices — no recording required.**

Solves the hardest problems in voice synthesis: **recording, corpus building, bulk generation, and resampling**.

A GUI tool for [Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS) VoiceDesign and VoiceClone.
From voice design to generating training data for [Style-Bert-VITS2](https://github.com/litagin02/Style-Bert-VITS2) — all in one place.

**Switch UI language, bundled corpus, and generation language with one click — JA / EN / ZH / KO supported**

---

## Overview

**Solves the voice problems that have been holding back AI Tubers, AI characters, game voice, and narration production.**

- Can't prepare original recordings, so you can't create a voice
- Running zero-shot inference without a proper TTS model
- Corpus collection and bulk audio generation are too much work

Voice design, bulk generation, and preprocessing — done in just a few button clicks.

**What you can do:**
- **Voice Design** — Generate a completely original voice from scratch using text prompts
- **Voice Gacha** — Keep regenerating until you find the voice you love
- **Bulk Corpus Synthesis** — Generate hundreds to thousands of lines with your chosen voice at the push of a button
- **Resample & esd.list generation** — Preprocessing for Style-Bert-VITS2 training, all handled automatically

Output is in Style-Bert-VITS2 training data format (44.1kHz WAV + esd.list), ready to use directly.
Output can also be used with other TTS engines.

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 / Linux WSL2 (tested) |
| Python | 3.10–3.12 (recommended: 3.12) |
| GPU | NVIDIA (CUDA required) |
| VRAM | 8GB+ (recommended: 16GB) |

**Tested environments:**

| OS | GPU | VRAM | RAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows 11 | RTX 4060 Ti | 16GB | 128GB |
| Windows 11 | RTX 3060 | 12GB | 64GB |
| Windows 11 / WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04) | RTX 5070 | 12GB | — |
| Windows 11 (VRAM 8GB) | — | 8GB | — |

> CPU-only operation has not been tested.

## Installation

```
1. Clone this repository or download as ZIP
2. Double-click setup.bat to run
3. After setup, launch with app.bat
```

**On Linux, use `setup.sh` / `app.sh`. Tested on WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04).**

`setup.bat` automatically handles venv creation, PyTorch, and all dependency installation.

If an NVIDIA GPU is detected, **faster-qwen3-tts** is installed automatically.
To add it manually later:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install faster-qwen3-tts
```

> **First launch note**: On the first run, the faster backend may fall back to standard. From the second run onward, faster will work correctly.

---

## Usage

After launching, step-by-step instructions are available in the **Manual tab** inside the app.

General workflow:

```
1. [Voice Design] tab — Design, preview, and save your voice
2. [Voice Clone]  tab — Bulk synthesize your corpus with the saved voice
3. [Tools]        tab — Resample and generate esd.list
4. [Settings]     tab — Check and switch inference backend
```

Steps 1 and 2 are all you need for basic use.

> **Note**: Pressing the stop button in Voice Clone will show "Error" in the status display. This is a Gradio behavior — the process has actually stopped correctly. All generated files are preserved.

## Supported Languages

### UI Language

Switchable from the Settings tab.

| Language | Code |
|---|---|
| Japanese | JA |
| English | EN |
| Chinese | ZH |
| Korean | KO |

### Voice Generation Language (Qwen3-TTS)

Both Voice Design and Voice Clone support the following 10 languages.
When using bundled corpora (JA/EN/ZH), the corpus language selector syncs automatically.
When using your own corpus, you can generate in all 10 languages.

| Language | Language |
|---|---|
| Japanese | Korean |
| English | German |
| Chinese | French |
| Spanish | Italian |
| Portuguese | Russian |

## Bundled Corpora

| File | Lines | Content |
|---|---|---|
| ita_emotion100.txt | 100 | ITA corpus (emotional expressions) |
| ita_recitation324.txt | 324 | ITA corpus (recitation) |
| mana652.txt | 652 | MANA corpus |
| rohan4600.txt | 4600 | ROHAN corpus |

Japanese (JA) is included as-is. English (EN) and Chinese (ZH) were translated offline using M2M-100, with all looping outputs and unknown token artifacts (`<unk>`) manually corrected.

## Passing Data to Style-Bert-VITS2

```
1. Copy the contents of output/{folder}/raw/ to Style-Bert-VITS2's Data/{model}/raw/
2. Generate esd.list using "Generate esd.list" in the Tools tab
3. Run preprocessing → training in the Style-Bert-VITS2 WebUI
```

esd.list format:
```
0001.wav|{speaker_name}|JP|text content
0002.wav|{speaker_name}|JP|text content
```

> **Note**: The language column can be set to JP / EN / ZH from the Tools tab.

---

## Inference Backends

| Backend | Speed | Supported Models |
|---|---|---|
| **faster** (recommended) | ~6–10x faster (RTF ~2.0) | 1.7B-VoiceDesign / 1.7B-Base |
| **standard** | Standard speed | All (CPU/GPU) |

The faster backend uses CUDA Graph optimization via [faster-qwen3-tts](https://github.com/andimarafioti/faster-qwen3-tts).
**0.6B-Base is not supported by faster** — when faster is selected, it automatically falls back to standard for this model.
